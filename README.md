# RealTimePeopleCounting
 this project uses the power of OpenCV's Object Detection and Tracking functions to accurately count the number of people in a given area in real-time. The project can be expanded to include additional features such as heat maps, which can show areas of high foot traffic, or facial recognition, which can be used to identify specific individuals.
